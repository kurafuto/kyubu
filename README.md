Minecraft Classic protocol implementation in Go, primarily to get the grips with
networking stuff.

There's not a roadmap right now, but I'd like to end up with an abstracted
implementation of the [Minecraft Classic Protocol](http://wiki.vg/Classic_Protocol)
that other people can use to make clients, servers, tunnels, and what have you.
